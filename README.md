## Example

![example of usage](/example.gif)

## Installation

```bash
git clone git@github.com:lrdiv/whip-cli.git
cd whip-cli
go build
```

## Usage

If the `whip` executable generated by `go build` is not in your `$PATH` you will need to be in the root directory of the repository when you run the following:

**Option 1**: Without any arguments you will be prompted for a URL from a streaming service

```bash
./whip
```

**Option 2**: You can also pass the URL as an argument to skip this step

```bash
./whip https://open.spotify.com/track/4uLU6hMCjMI75M1A2tKUQC
```
